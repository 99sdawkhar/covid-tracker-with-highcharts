# Covid Tracker with HighCharts

Just an FYI, I have observed that API doesn't fetch correct data at mid-night IST time as the used API is updated based on US timing so avoid checking data at mid-night IST time.

Also, for some countries API, fetches state-wise data which is not under the score of this project. Hence, graphs might show unexpected behaviour for some countries.
